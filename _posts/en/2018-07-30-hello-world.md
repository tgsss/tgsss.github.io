I've wanted to have my own blog for a long time. And here it is, done. Of course, if you dig deeper, it's not exactly my own â€“ I'm using GitHub Pages for hosting. But perhaps someday, I'll move it to my own server (if such an opportunity arises).

I'll be sharing information here about various things I'm working on or have completed (though who am I kidding, they rarely progress to this stage).

That's how things are.
