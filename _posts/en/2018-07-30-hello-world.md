For a long time, I have harbored the desire to possess my own blog. And lo and behold, it has finally materialized. Admittedly, if we delve 
deeper, it may not be entirely my own, as it resides on the hosting platform of Github Pages. However, there is the possibility that one day 
I will relocate it to a self-owned server, should the opportunity present itself.

Here, I will be sharing information about various things I am doing or have accomplished (although, let's face it, they reach this stage quite rarely).

Such is the way of things.
